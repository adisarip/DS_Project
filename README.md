### **NOTE: Presentation video is available in the "presentation" folder of this repository.**

## Introduction
There are many spanning tree based termination detection algorithms in the distributed systems literature. Of all of them we have shortlisted the following three algorithms for analysis:
>- Rodney. W. Topor
>- Chandrashekhar Venkatesan
>- R.K Arora & M.N Gupta

Below mentioned is the brief introduction on the above three algorithms.

> **Rodney.W.Topor**  
> Each leaf process after it has terminated, sends its token to its parent. When a parent process terminates and after it has received a token from each of its children, it sends a token to its parent. This way, each process indicates to its parent process that the sub-tree below it has terminated. In a similar manner, the tokens get propagated to the root. The root of the tree concludes that termination has occurred, after it has received a token from each of its children. In order to enable the root node to know that a node in its children’s sub-tree, that was assumed to be terminated, has become active due to a message, a coloring scheme for tokens and nodes is used. All tokens are initialized to WHITE. If a process had sent a message to some other process, it sends a BLACK token to its parent on termination, otherwise, it sends a WHITE token on termination.  

> **Chandrashekhar Venkatesan**  
> An extension of Rodney.W.Topor, where instead of sending a black token the sender will wait for an acknowledge from reciever stating the reciever bcame idle.  

> **R.K Arora & M.N Gupta**  
> Addresses the unneccsary idle wait issue in Rodney by choosing 2 different phase: detection and termination. whenever a node is terminated it will send termination message stating it is in passive state and when it again becomes active a new detection message is sent and the parent will wait for its corresponding termination message again.  

## Solution Approach
> **Configuration**
>- For “N” nodes we create (N+1) OpenMPI processes.
>- Process with Rank=0 will be a master/manager process.
>- Processes with ranks 1 to N will represent N nodes of the MST.
>- As naming convention, we call master/manager process as MASTER and others as WORKER processes respectively.
>- In OpenMPI, we only use MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator for blocking send and receive communications between processes.
>- Messages supported: MSG_CONFIG, MSG_DONE, MSG_KILL, MSG_COMPUTE, MSG_REPEAT, MSG_TOKEN.
>- Types of nodes: RootNode, InternalNode, LeafNode

> **MASTER Process**
>- Reads the input data file containing the graph.
>- Instantiate a Graph object and saved the input graph in it, for further computations.
>- Runs Kruskal's algorithm with a Union-Find data structure to compute the MST as an adjacency list.
>- From the adjacency list identify the list of child nodes for each node in the spanning tree.
>- Computes the routing table for the MST for nodes to send messages among themselves.
>- For each node in the MST send the RootNode, ChildNodes and Routing Array, specific to that node/process only.
>- Generate a random compute message, with a source & destination selected randomly, and send it to the source node WORKER process.
>- Wait for MSG_DONE message from the RootNode indicating the termination detection algorithm is completed.
>- Send MSG_KILL message to all the WORKER processes to terminate them gracefully.

> **WORKER Process**
>- Instantiate a Node object.
>- Receive all the MSG_CONFIG messages from the MASTER & store them in the Node object.
>- If the current WORKER process rank matches the COMPUTE message source node, then the compute message is saved, otherwise discarded.
>- The WORKER node then start executing a computations loop (which would randomly take any time between 1 to 5 seconds).
>- During the computations, the node will check if it has any saved compute message.
>- If its there, then it sends the messages using the routing array, and mark its token color as BLACK. Now it is a BLACK process.
>- All the leaf WORKER nodes, after their respective computations are done, will start the termination detection by sending MSG_TOKEN to their parent node.
>- All the internal nodes will wait until they have received MSG_TOKEN messages from all their child nodes.
>- Once received if there is a BLACK token among them, then forward the same to the parent node. Otherwise, send a WHITE token to the parent node.
>- A BLACK process, after sending it BLACK token to the parent node, will mark its token as WHITE.
>- The Root WORKER node will wait for the tokens from all the child nodes.
>- Once received if there is a BLACK token in them, then it will initiate a REPEAT signal to all the child nodes.
>- Once this REPEAT signal reaches the leaf node, the leaf node will re-initiate termination detection algorithm again.
>- After the Root node has received all the WHITE tokens from all its child nodes, it will send MSG_DONE message to the MASTER process.
>- Once the message MSG_KILL is received – stop and exit the WORKER process.
